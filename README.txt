Java SDK 13

In order to excute the code you need to run the server first, as the client needs to connect to it. 
To run the server you need to select the main in the server package and run it.

After the server is up and running you can run the client. To disconnect the client from the server you only 
need to close the JFrame, and the server will detect that and disconnect the client. 
Running the client is similar to how you run the server, just go to the client package and run the main in there.

if you run the database some default staticstics already exist, so the graphs will have some values in them.

there is a default user that is called "user" and has the password "user",it is hardcoded in the database as the password doesn't
match the MIT Password Policy.


To create a new user, once you enter the Client view you can click on the "Register" button, and then introduce all the needed credentials.
